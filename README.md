This image showcases the client-side social media application.

This project is a client-side social media application developed as part of the **JavaScript 2** course assignment and later enhanced during the **CSS Frameworks** course assignment. It implements core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for posts and includes a user authentication system. The application is styled using **Tailwind CSS** and built with modern web development tools like **Vite** and **Vitest**. While essential features are implemented, additional functionalities are planned for future contributors.

## Noroff API Integration

This application uses the **Noroff API** for backend functionality. The API is provided to students for practicing and completing assignments. Below are key details about the API:

### API Base URL

The base URL for the **v2** API is:
https://v2.api.noroff.dev/

### Endpoints

All endpoints should be prefixed with the base URL. For example:

- **Fetch Posts**: `https://v2.api.noroff.dev/posts`
- **User Authentication**: `https://v2.api.noroff.dev/auth`

### CORS Enabled

The API has CORS enabled, allowing you to access it directly from `localhost` during development without encountering CORS errors.

### Important Notes

- All content posted to this API is publicly visible to other students.
- Your account must use your Noroff email address.
- Ensure that the content you post is appropriate for this platform.

## Test User Credentials

For testing purposes, you can use the following test user credentials:

- **Email**: `test1001@stud.noroff.no`
- **Password**: `passwordtest1001`
